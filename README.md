[![Build Status](https://github.com/trailofbits/sholva/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trailofbits/sholva/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

_shol'va_ is a tool for generating zero knowledge proofs of program execution, composed of

- _mttn_: an instruction-resolution program tracer
- _tiny86_: a Verilog and [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/) trace verifier circuit

## Usage

> **Note**: _shol'va_ does native tracing X86 Linux programs, and as a result is strictly limited to that architecture.

### Dependencies

`sholva` is built using [nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_package_manager).
It is recommended to use the [Determinate Systems installer](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer):

```sh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

## Building

### mttn

```sh
$ nix build .#mttn
```

This builds:

- `bin/mttn`: tracer binary
- `traces/*.trace.txt`: self-test tracing results

Enter a shell with development dependencies:

```sh
$ cd mttn
$ nix develop .#mttn
```

Manual testing:

```sh
# build all the of the test binaries
$ make -C test elfs
# run the mttn self-tests
$ cargo test
```

### tiny86

```sh
$ nix build .#tiny86
```

This builds:

- `circuit/tiny86.blif`: synthesized circuit

Enter a shell with development dependencies:

```sh
$ cd tiny86
$ nix develop .#tiny86
```

Manual testing:

```bash
# test the full Tiny86 circuit test suite
$ make _test-tiny86
# test the Tiny86 circuit Clash components Haskell source
$ make _test-clash
# test the Tiny86 circuit Verilog components
$ make _test-verilog
# test the Tiny86 circuit Verilog components, isolating modules
$ SHOLVA_MODULES="alu syscall" make _test-verilog
# test the manual end-to-end test suite
$ make _test-pipeline
```

### sv_circuit

```sh
$ nix build .#sv_circuit
```
This builds the `sv-compositor` binary, which takes a BLIF file (defining a single step of Tiny86)
and trace artifacts as input and yields proof artifacts 
(currently, a SIEVE IR0 circuit, public input, and private input) as output.

Enter a shell with development dependencies:

```sh
$ cd sv_circuit
$ nix develop .#sv_circuit
```

Manual testing (from the development environment):
```sh
$ cargo test
```
