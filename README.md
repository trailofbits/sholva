[![Build Status](https://github.com/trailofbits/sholva/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trailofbits/sholva/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

*shol'va* is a Verilog implementation of a Tiny86 trace verifier.

## Usage

### Dependencies

*shol'va* currently depends on iVerilog, Verilator, Python 3; and Ruby and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) for code generation.
These must be available as `iverilog`, `verilator`, `python3`, `ruby`, and `stack` respectively.

### Building

*shol'va* currently builds as a sanity test, producing no actual outputs.
To run the build:

```bash
$ make
```

If you have `sv-netlist` on your PATH, you can build a BLIF-formatted netlist:

```bash
# creates tiny86.blif
$ make netlistify
```

Independently, you can run *shol'va*'s self tests:

```bash
$ make check
# or limit the checks to a subset
$ make check CHECKS="alu fetch execute"
```

You can also run *shol'va*'s modules through Verilator's linter.

```bash
$ make lint
```
